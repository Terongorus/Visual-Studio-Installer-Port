Copilot is now seamlessly integrated into Visual Studio's code editor to significantly boost your productivity by generating doc comments for your functions.

With automatic doc comment generation enabled for your project, you can simply type the comment pattern according to your settings configuration (e.g., `///`), and Copilot will instantly complete the function description based on the function's content. This feature saves you valuable time and effort, allowing you to focus more on coding and less on documentation.
