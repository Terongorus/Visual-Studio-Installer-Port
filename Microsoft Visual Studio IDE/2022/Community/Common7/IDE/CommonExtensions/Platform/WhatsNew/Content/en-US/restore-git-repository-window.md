As your dedicated environment for branch operations, the [Git Repository window](vscmd://Team.Git.GoToGitSynchronization) {KeyboardShortcut:Team.Git.GoToGitSynchronization} is likely at the core of your day-to-day development. If you find yourself frequently reopening it with every Visual Studio session, this update is designed to save you time and effort.

We've added a new setting to [Git > Settings](vscmd://Team.Git.Settings) that automatically restores the Git Repository window when restarting Visual Studio. Additionally, the window will be included in your saved window layouts, enhancing your customization options.

By default, this feature is off to keep things running smoothly for those who don't need it. But if you like the convenience, this setting is perfect for you.
