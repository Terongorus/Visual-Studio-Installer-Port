Want to know how much you've used Copilot this month? Visual Studio now includes a **Copilot Consumptions** panel to easily track your usage!

Whether you're using Copilot Free or a paid plan, you can check your number of chat requests and code completions right from the IDE.

Access it by clicking the **Copilot badge** in the top-right corner of your IDE and selecting **Copilot Consumptions**.

This opens a panel showing your current usage for the month.

> Tip: If you're using premium models, you'll also see usage multipliers listed in the model picker, so you always know exactly what you're using.
