The [Git Repository window](vscmd://Team.Git.GoToGitSynchronization) {KeyboardShortcut:Team.Git.GoToGitSynchronization} is your go-to place to understand your Git history. As you work on a local branch, it may get out of sync with your remote, either because you created new commits (outgoing) or there are new commits to pull (incoming).

With the new outgoing/incoming filter available in the toolbar, you can instantly spot these unsynced commits. Your commits, their commits â€“ scan them with ease and stay perfectly in sync!
