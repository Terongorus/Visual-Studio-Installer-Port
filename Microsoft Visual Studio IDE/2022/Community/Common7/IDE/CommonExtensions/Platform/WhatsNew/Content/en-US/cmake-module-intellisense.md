We are thrilled to announce that we have added support for IntelliSense-based completions and quick info for CMake modules in Visual Studio. Now, you can view all available CMake modules and learn more about them directly from the Visual Studio editor, making your development process smoother and more efficient.

### Quick Info

When you hover over a referenced CMake module, IntelliSense provides detailed information about the selected module, helping you understand its usage and functionality at a glance.

### Completion

When you start typing a CMake module in your `CMakeLists.txt` or other CMake script files, IntelliSense will provide a list of available modules to choose from.
