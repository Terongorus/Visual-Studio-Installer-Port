We're excited to introduce a set of powerful new features in Visual Studio that streamline your workflow and improve the extension management experience. These updates ensure that you stay up to date effortlessly while giving you more control over how and when updates are applied.

### What's New?

**Seamless auto updates**

Visual Studio will now automatically trigger updates when you open the application, ensuring you always have the latest features and fixes without manual intervention.

**Restart gold bar for applied updates**

When updates are applied, a gold bar notification will appear, prompting you to restart Visual Studio for the changes to take effect.

**Auto update settings in extension page**

We've made auto update settings more accessible by integrating them directly into the extension page, giving you quick access to configuration options.

**Simplified settings experience**

We've streamlined the settings UI, making it easier to configure auto updates and other related preferences with fewer clicks and clearer options.

**Excluded extensions list**

Visual Studio now features an Excluded extensions list that auto-populates, helping you manage extensions that should not be updated automatically. This is particularly useful for mission-critical extensions where you prefer to control version updates manually.

These enhancements are designed to improve usability, reduce update friction, and give you greater control over your development environment while ensuring you benefit from the latest improvements.
